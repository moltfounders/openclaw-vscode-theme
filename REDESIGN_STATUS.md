# README Redesign - Status

## ✅ Completed

### Visual Assets Generated
- **Hero Banner** (`assets/hero-banner.png`) — Premium gradient with logo, tagline, and key features
- **Color Palette** (`assets/palette.png`) — Visual swatches of all theme colors with hex codes

### README Redesigned
- Professional copy with clear messaging
- Strategic use of emojis (not overdone)
- Clear value proposition ("Why This Theme?")
- Visual hierarchy with proper sections
- Installation made simple and copy-friendly
- Design philosophy section
- Community and contribution CTAs

### Assets Structure
`assets/` folder created with:
- `hero-banner.html` and `hero-banner.png`
- `palette.html` and `palette.png`

## 📸 Next Step: Screenshots

The README references these screenshots that need to be captured with the new theme:

1. `docs/screenshots/theme-editor-crop.png` — TypeScript code with syntax highlighting
2. `docs/screenshots/theme-window-only.png` — Full VSCode window with theme applied

**Action needed:**

1. Open VSCode with `demo.ts` file
2. Apply the theme: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Preferences: Color Theme" → "OpenClaw MoltFounders Dark"
3. Let me know when ready, and I'll capture clean window-only screenshots to replace the broken ones

**Screenshot plan:**
- Use window-capture skill for clean, background-free captures
- Target the "Code" app with yabai + Python/Quartz
- Replace existing screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`

## 📊 Transformation

**Before:** Basic, utilitarian, zero personality
**After:** Premium, developer-focused, visual storytelling with actual substance

*Everything's locally committed in the workspace. Ready for screenshot phase.*
