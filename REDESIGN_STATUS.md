### Assets Structure
`assets/` folder created with:

## ✅ Screenshots Captured

All screenshots replaced with new window captures:

1. `docs/screenshots/theme-editor-crop.png` — TypeScript editor view (resized for focus)
2. `docs/screenshots/theme-window-only.png` — Full VSCode window
3. `docs/screenshots/theme-window-only-clean.png` — Clean variant

Captured using window-capture skill with yabai + Python/Quartz for clean, background-free screenshots.
