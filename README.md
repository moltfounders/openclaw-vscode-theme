## ⚡ Why This Theme?

Most VSCode themes look okay at first glance. But after 4 hours? 🫠

Every dark theme claims to be easy on the eyes. Few actually deliver. You know the feeling: squinting at keywords, losing track of parentheses, eyes burning at 2 AM.

**MoltFounders Dark is different.**

I built this after years of searching for the perfect dark theme. One that stays fresh after marathon coding sessions. That highlights your code without shouting at you. That feels premium, not patched together.

This isn't just another dark theme. It's a carefully crafted developer experience.

## 🎨 The Palette

Every color was chosen with intention. Inspired by the MoltFounders brand, tuned for editor legibility.

![Color Palette](assets/palette.png)

**Background:** `#0A0A0A` → Deep black, easy on the eyes
**Panel:** `#1A1A1A` → Subtle depth without distraction
**Border:** `#252525` → Clean separation, never harsh
**Primary Accent:** `#24A1DE` (Molt cyan) → Your code stands out
**Success:** `#2DD100` → Tests pass? Celebrate that green
**Alert:** `#EF4444` → Errors can't hide
**Foreground:** `#F5F5F7` → Crisp text, never washed out

## 🔧 What Makes It Different

Most themes list RGB values and call it a day. This theme is different because:

1. **Brand-inspired, not palette-generated**
   - Colors come from the MoltFounders visual identity
   - Tuned specifically for code readability
   - Every color has a purpose

2. **Optimized for real-world use**
   - Tested in actual codebases (TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, shell)
   - Validated for long coding sessions
   - Designed for people who code all day

3. **Premium aesthetics**
   - Not just "dark" — carefully crafted visual hierarchy
   - Subtle depth without distraction
   - Professional polish you can feel

4. **Syntax precision**
   - Different token types use different colors
   - Comments don't look like keywords
   - Strings, numbers, operators all distinguishable at a glance

## 🧰 Customization

Want to tweak something? The theme file is yours to customize:

**Theme file:** `theme/openclaw-moltfounders-dark.json`

All token colors are clearly labeled. Change a value, reload the theme, see the result instantly.
